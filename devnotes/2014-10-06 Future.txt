TODO: Blog post, "In Hindsight: How I'd do it Even Better"
Slowly but surely nearing the end of my PhD. Many ideas I won't have time
to explore.

Negative info should be propagated using bit sets. This would allow having a
type test, is_object() for all objects at once, and still gain type information.
May also be able to have multiple kinds of typed arrays and an is_array() test.

Some amount of constant propagation should be built into versioning. Useful
for many simple cases. Booleans come to mind. Constant shapes.

Memory allocation of AST & IR nodes should be thought of from the beginning
- Either zones or pools. Pools probably more flexible/safe.
- Want representation as "flat" as possible, less pointer chasing
  - Large flat array of instruction and label objects?
- No blocks?
  - Two branches possible, one means go straight to the next instr
- Type tags, reg/slot alloc, metainf, should be encoded in the IR if possible
  - instr output can specify reg,slot,tag

Should do transformations at the IR level.
- IR needs new constructs to integrate versioning
- Guards? Child sub-versions of other blocks with preconditions?
- Incremental generation, need branch edge "stubs"
- May be possible to completely eliminate the context with annotations/guards
  - save memory, context lookups are espensive, context objects are big

Incremental inlining at the IR level
- Could try to reg alloc inlined code
- Probably want on-the-fly stack allocation
  - Except for parameters, these get a reserved slot?
- If more stack slots are needed, could resize stack frame
  - Remap slots and invalidate all compiled blocks for the function

Garbage collector, may want GC maps, live variables at GC-ing points along
with known type tags so these don't need to be spilled.

Should use the C stack, match call and return instructions
- CPUs are optimized for this
- Use full words for type tags, for speed and simplicity
  - Reuse words in on-the-fly stack slot allocation
- Want proper calling convention with registers for visible args
  - Can assume that most fns do not use clos argument
  - Pass argc in a reg, even though not used most of the time
    - If not used, not touched
  - Regs for words and types of first 3 args, maybe "this"
