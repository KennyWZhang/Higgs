Negative info should be propagated using bit sets. This would allow having a
type test, is_object() for all objects at once, and still gain type information.

Some amount of constant propagation should be built in. Useful for many simple
cases.

Should do transformations at the IR level.

Incremental inlining at the IR level
- Could try to reg alloc inlined code
- Probably want on-the-fly stack allocation
  - Except for parameters
- If more stack slots are needed, could resize stack frame
  - Remap slots and invalidate all compiled blocks for the function
